# Styled Components

A small introduction to styled components ðŸ’…

## Installation 
In directory of your project, run:
```bash
$ npm install styled-components
```
## Usage
Start by import the style components package into your file.
```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

Let's create a button element using the styled-component library
```javascript
const Button = styled.button``;
```

This is the basic setup for a styled component. The 'Button' variable is now a React component that can now be used like any other React component. It's important to note the three main parts of creating a styled component. First, we are using the styled-component library that we brought in as `styled`. Second, we are declaring what kind of element we want this component. In this case, we want a `button` element. Third, we are using backticks. This is where we will store our css so when we add our styling to this component, it will look like the following.

```javascript
const Button = styled.button`
  background: palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  color: palevioletred;
  margin: 0 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
`
```

This backtick syntax is a newer feature to Javascript known as `tagged template literals`. This pretty much allows us to call functions within backticks.
